# Open Source Automated Chessboard Project
An **open source automated chessboard project** based on <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Automated-Chessboard/" target="_blank">instructables.com by Greg06</a>. It's a community-driven effort to create a self-contained electronic chessboard that can be used for playing chess. The project is **open source**, meaning that the design plans, software, and hardware schematics are freely available for anyone to use, modify, or contribute to.

The goal of this project is to create a high-quality automated chessboard that is affordable, accessible, and customizable. It aims to bring the benefits of modern technology to the game of chess, while at the same time fostering a community of makers, hobbyists, and chess enthusiasts who can work together to improve and evolve the design.

## Some key features of the open source automated chessboard project include:
- Open source design plans, software, and hardware schematics
- Affordable and accessible to a wide range of users
- Customizable for personal preferences or specific needs
- Community-driven development and improvement

## Regular updates and new features based on user feedback and contributions
